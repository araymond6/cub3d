Direction:

x-	North = -1
	South = 1
y-	North, South = 0
	East = 1
	West = -1

Camplane:
Takes care of the FOV; 0.60 is a FOV of 60 degree, for example
Camangle:
Vertical camera angle; 0.5 is straight forward
Camera:
Represents the x coordinate on the camera plane. Right side = 1, left side = -1, center = 0.
Used to normalise the ray direction.

Sidedist:
Distance to the nearest gridline.

Deltadist:
Calculates how far the ray needs to travel across horizontal or vertical grid lines
for each step the ray takes. Calculated by the reciprocal of the ray direction.

Step:
It represents
